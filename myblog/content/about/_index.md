Welcome to my website! I am Tien Nguyen, an enthusiast in the world of customising linux workspace and currently daily-driving with Arch Linux on my machine.

Here you will find contents about my experiences with all kind of technologies, ranging from programming to hardware systems.

I’m deeply passionate about technology and aspire to build a career in the tech industry. 

I listen to all genres of music depending on what I am doing atm. My favorite band is Skillet, a rock band based in the US. It's the strong vibe and energy the songs carry that pump my will up in the darkest hours of my life ,ie. an exam :) The top of my Skillet playlist are "Awake and Alive", "Feel Invincible" and "Monster".

When I’m not exploring the latest gadgets or working on new skills, you can find me participating in online chess competitions as one of my hobbies.
